Available Schema:
{schema}

Question Analysis:
{breakdown}

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Table Requirements:
   - Use table alias 'rt' for remitTransactions
   - Use table alias 'c' for customers
   - Include create_date in transaction queries for temporal ordering

2. Query Guidelines:
   - Use appropriate JOIN types (INNER, LEFT) based on data needs
   - Add TOP clause for potentially large result sets
   - Include ORDER BY for transaction listings
   - Use proper date comparisons for time-based queries

Example Query Patterns:

1. Transaction Lookup:
   
   SELECT TOP 100
       rt.remit_pin_number,
       rt.send_amount,
       rt.receive_amount,
       rt.send_currency,
       rt.receive_currency,
       rt.create_date,
       c.full_name as sender_name
   FROM dbo.remitTransactions rt
   JOIN dbo.customers c ON rt.sender_id = c.id
   WHERE c.full_name = 'John Smith'
   ORDER BY rt.create_date DESC
   

2. Transaction Analysis:
  
   SELECT 
       COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
       SUM(send_amount) as total_amount,
       send_currency,
       send_country
   FROM dbo.remitTransactions
   WHERE create_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'
   GROUP BY send_currency, send_country
   

3. Customer Search:
   
   SELECT 
       c.customer_id,
       c.full_name,
       c.customer_type,
       c.country
   FROM dbo.customers c
   WHERE c.country = 'USA'
   

IMPORTANT: Your response must contain ONLY the SQL query - no explanations, no comments, no markdown formatting. Just the raw SQL query.
