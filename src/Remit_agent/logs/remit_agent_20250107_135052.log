1. **No Transactions Available**: There might be no transactions recorded in the `remitTransactions` table.
2. **Data Access Issues**: There could be an issue with accessing the data, such as permissions or connectivity problems.
3. **Query Logic**: The logic of the query might not align with the current data structure or contents.

To address this, you may want to:
- Verify that there are transactions in the `remitTransactions` table.
- Check for any potential data access issues.
- Review the query logic to ensure it matches the database schema and data.

If you need further assistance, please provide more context or details about the data and the database setup.
