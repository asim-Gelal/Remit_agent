1. **No Transactions Available**: There might be no records in the `dbo.remitTransactions` table.
2. **Data Access Issues**: There could be an issue with accessing the database or the tables.
3. **Incorrect Query Execution**: The query might not have been executed correctly.

To resolve this, you may want to:

- Verify that there are entries in the `dbo.remitTransactions` and `dbo.customers` tables.
- Check for any database connection issues.
- Ensure that the query is executed in the correct database context.

If you need further assistance, please provide more details or check the database for any anomalies.
